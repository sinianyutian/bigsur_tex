The creation of high-quality semantically parsed 3D models for dense metropolitan areas is a fundamental urban modeling problem.
%
Although recent advances in acquisition techniques and processing algorithms have resulted in large-scale imagery or 3D polygonal reconstructions, such data-sources are typically noisy, and incomplete, with no semantic structure.  
% 
%
In this paper, we present an automatic data fusion technique that produces high-quality {\outputM}s of city blocks.
%
From coarse polygonal meshes, \streetI, and \GISds, we formulate a binary integer program that globally balances sources of error to produce semantically parsed mass models with associated \facade elements. 
We demonstrate our system on four city regions of varying complexity; our examples typically contain densely built urban blocks spanning hundreds of buildings. In our largest example, we produce a \outputM\ of 37 city blocks spanning a total of 1,011 buildings at a scale and quality previously impossible to achieve automatically.
